## 🚀 Project — Sampark (Ignite Hackathon 2025)

**Problem Statement (Smart Communities):**  
In residential societies, local markets, or campus communities, communication and collaboration are often fragmented. Important information doesn’t reach everyone, resources aren’t shared effectively, and opportunities for collaboration are missed. A smarter system of engagement could solve many of these gaps.

**Challenge:**  
> How can we build platforms or tools that make communities more connected, collaborative, and resourceful — while ensuring inclusivity and trust?

**Our Solution:**  
We built **Sampark** — a smart community platform that focuses on seamless communication, resource sharing, event coordination, and trust-building features for societies and campuses.

**Deployed (live) demo:**  
🔗 https://ignite-hackthon.vercel.app/
