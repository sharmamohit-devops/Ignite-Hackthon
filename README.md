## 🚀 **Project Overview**

### 🧩 Problem Statement – *Smart Communities*
In residential societies, local markets, or campus communities, communication and collaboration are often fragmented.  
Important information doesn’t reach everyone, resources aren’t shared effectively, and opportunities for collaboration are missed.  
A smarter system of engagement could solve many of these gaps.

> 💭 **Challenge:**  
> How can we build platforms or tools that make communities more connected, collaborative, and resourceful — while ensuring inclusivity and trust?
